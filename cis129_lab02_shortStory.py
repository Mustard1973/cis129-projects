# A haiku is a traditional Japanese poem consisting of three lines with a 5-7-5 syllable structure. 
# They often focus on nature or emotions but in this case it has nothing to do with nature.

# This will print the title of the Haiku
print('My Programming Haiku')

# This will print the first line of the haiku
print('Bits flow through the code,')

# This will print the second line of the haiku
print('Logic dances in the night,')

# This will print the third line of the haiku
print('Dreams in ones and zeros.')
